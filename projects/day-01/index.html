                 <blockquote cite="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemistry">
             <p> <q><i><b>Chemistry</b> is the <em>scientific</em> discipline involved with 
                 elements and compounds composed of atoms, molecules and ions: 
                 their composition, structure, properties, behavior and the changes 
                 they undergo during a reaction with other substances. 
                 In the scope of its subject, chemistry occupies an intermediate 
                 position between physics and biology. It is sometimes called the 
                 central science because it provides a foundation for understanding 
                 both basic and applied <strong>scientific</strong> disciplines at a fundamental level.</i></q></p>

        <h2> How to start learning Calisthenics</h2> 
             <p> <b>Calisthenics</b> is a form of exercise consisting of a variety of movements which exercise large muscle groups, <i>such as standing, grasping, pushing, etc.</i> </p>
             <p> Exercises are often performed rhythmically and with <del>minimal</del> <ins>no</ins> equipment, as bodyweight exercises.</p>
             <p> They are intended to increase <b>body strength, body fitness, and flexibility,</b> through movements such as pulling or pushing oneself up, 
                 bending, jumping, or swinging, using only one's body weight for resistance; usually performed in high-repetition sets to develop muscular endurance. </p>

             <p> Key guidelines when doing calisthenics. (Ordered List)</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li> Warm-up: Start with a <i>5-10</i> minute warm-up to get your blood flowing and muscles ready. </li> 
                           <ul>
                               <li> Light jogging or brisk walking</li>
                               <li> Jumping jacks</li>
                               <li> Arm circles</li> 
                           </ul>            
                        <li> Basic Exercises: Begin with fundamental calisthenics exercises such as push-ups, squats, lunges, and planks. Aim for 3 sets of 10-15 repetitions for each exercise.</li>
                        <li> Progression: As you get stronger, gradually increase the difficulty of your workouts by adding more repetitions, sets, or trying more advanced variations of the exercises.</li>
                        <li> Consistency: Aim to work out at least 3-4 times a week to see progress. Consistency is key in building strength and endurance.</li>
                        <li> Rest and Recovery: Ensure you give your muscles time to recover by incorporating rest days into your routine. This helps prevent injury and promotes muscle growth.</li>
                    </ol>
