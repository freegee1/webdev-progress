Welcome to my public learning log.   
This repository tracks my progress as I learn **HTML**, **CSS**, and eventually **JavaScript**, documenting both my **code projects** and **daily reflections**.

## ðŸ“˜ Learning Resources
Iâ€™m following **Jon Duckettâ€™s _HTML & CSS: Design and Build Websites_ (2011)** as my primary guide.  
Each dayâ€™s note summarizes chapters, tags, and takeaways from the book, along with my own hands-on code.
